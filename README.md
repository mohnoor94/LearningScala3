# My Scala 3 Learning Journey

This is another **learning-by-doing** repo for learning Scala 3.

# Should I start with Scala 2?
I have an older repo to learn and teach Scala 2: [LearningScala](https://github.com/mohnoor94/LearningScala).
I will try to start in this Scala 3 repo from scratch as much as I can, but in any way, you will find some contents
in the Scala 2 repo are still highly relevant.

## My Main Resources
I will use multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources
I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):

* My [LearningScala](https://github.com/mohnoor94/LearningScala) repository.
* [Learning to code in Scala](https://scala.zone/courses/scala). A Free course by [Scala Zone](https://scala.zone/).
