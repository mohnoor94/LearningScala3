/**
 * - "Scala is exclusively a compiled language, and there are no interpreters for Scala source code."
 * - "Scala wholeheartedly chooses and endorses the static approach."
 * ***
 * "Many programming languages allow us to write code, and run it directly, converting the source code into machine
 * code and running it, as it is being read. This is called interpretation,
 * and contrasts with compilation, which fully converts an entire program from source code to machine code before any
 * of it is executed.
 * Pieces of software which perform these actions are called interpreters and compilers respectively."
 * ...
 * ""Static" and "dynamic" can be used, quite generally, to describe those details of a program that are known at
 * compiletime and those which are known only at runtime, and different Scala language features may be involved in
 * asserting them. But the vast majority of static assertions the Scala compiler makes are encoded through types."
